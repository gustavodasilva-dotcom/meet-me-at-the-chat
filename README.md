### About the project

This project was created using Node.js and Socket.io. All data is saved in memory -- which means that, if you reload the page, everything will be gone. But I have plans to create new functionalities to this project -- including database and whatnot. But, everything is in due time.

### How to run?

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

`npm install`

Now, choose one of the following commands to run the project:

`npm run dev`

Or:

`npm run start`
